# Automatic-Smart-Cart
Shopping can be enjoyable, but long queues at billing counters often make checkout slow and frustrating. 
Traditional manual billing—where each item’s barcode must be scanned by a cashier—introduces delays and lowers customer satisfaction. 
This project presents an Automated Smart Trolley Billing System that streamlines the checkout process using RFID technology and an Arduino microcontroller.
Every product in the store is fitted with an RFID tag, and the trolley is equipped with an RFID reader that automatically detects items as they are placed inside. 
The system retrieves each product’s name and price and displays them on an LCD screen, while the total bill is updated in real time. If an item is removed, 
its cost is automatically deducted from the total.When shopping is complete, the customer presses a button to finalize the bill, and the shopkeeper verifies the purchase using a master RFID card.
This approach reduces manual scanning, expedites billing, and improves the overall shopping experience by providing accurate, real‑time billing directly on the trolley.
