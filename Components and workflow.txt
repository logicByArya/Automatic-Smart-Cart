Components Required

1.	Arduino Uno / Mega         	Main controller for the system
2.	RFID Reader (MFRC522)	        To detect tagged items
3.	RFID Tags (one per product)	Unique ID for each product
4.	LCD Display (16x2  I2C)	        To show items and the total cost
5.	Buzzer (optional)	        For product scan confirmation
6.	Push button	                To finalise the billing
7.	Power source	                9V battery or adapter
8.	Breadboard & jumper wires	For circuit connections

Work Flow

1. Each product in the supermarket has an RFID tag with a unique ID.
2. The RFID reader on the trolley scans the tag when an item is placed inside.
3. The Arduino checks the tag ID in its database (a list stored in the code or SD card).
4. The corresponding item name and price appear on the LCD screen.
5. The total amount updates automatically as items are added or removed.
6. When the customer is done shopping, they press a button to get the final bill.
7. At the exit counter, a master RFID card can verify that the cart contents   match the paid bill.
